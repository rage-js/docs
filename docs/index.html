          "<strong>RAGE</strong>" is a data management approach that
          enables offline-first applications by caching data locally in JSON
          files. It connects to your MongoDB, Firebase, or other no-sql databases,
          retrieves the data, and stores it locally in a JSON format. 
          
          <br />
          <br />

          With RAGE, you can perform CRUD operations on the local JSON files, and in the
          background, RAGE will synchronize the changes with your remote database
          at regular intervals. This approach improves application performance,
          provides offline support, and reduces the load on your remote database.

          <strong>Key Benefits:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Improved application performance 
            </li>
            <li>Offline support </li>
            <li>Reduced load on remote databases</li>
            <li>Easy data synchronization ## RAGE.js</li>
          </ul>

          "**RAGE.js**" however, is the implementation of the RAGE approach,
          providing a set of tools to execute this methodology on different bases.
          It consists of four packages, each designed to work with specific use
          cases. - [core](https://github.com/rage-js/core) ⚡ - Core package for
          running the RAGE main loop - [tools](https://github.com/rage-js/tools)
          🛠️ - Package for performing CRUD operations on the localized JSON files,
          without disturbing the RAGE main loop -
          [cli](https://github.com/rage-js/cli) ⚙️ - A CLI package for creating
          new `node.js` applications with RAGE configured -
          [atlas](https://github.com/rage-js/atlas) 🧭 - A CLI package for
          performing operations on the local JSON files, without using code. ##
          RAGE Methods Even if the approach works, you can still customize the
          behavior of what to do in the middle of the instance, etc with these
          three primary methods: 1. [Push After Interval
          (PAI)](#push-after-interval) 2. [Push On Update (POU)](#push-on-update)
          3. [No Interval (NI)](#no-interval) ### Push After Interval In the
          middle of the instance, it will push the local JSON files' data to the
          cloud databases of your choice after every certain interval given by the
          user. This is the most efficient way compared to the other methods. >
          [!NOTE] > The loop that runs to synochronize the cloud database is
          called as the **"RAGE main loop"** ### Push On Update This method will
          make the application push on every update that occurs on the local
          files. This is the most less efficient way compared to the other methods
          but it still can be used in certain cases. ### No Interval This method
          does not perform any task at the middle of the instance, except for
          synchronizing the changes on local JSON data with the the cloud database
          of your choice at the end of the instance, just like every other method.
          You can set the method of your choice when creating your application
          through [cli](https://github.com/rage-js/cli) as well. OR if you want to
          change the method explictly, you can change your `rage.config.json` file
          like this: ```json { ... "method": "PAI", // PAI | POU | NI
          "methodSpecificSettings": { ... } } ``` where `methodSpecificSettings`
          depends upon your method, if you are using `PAI` method, then you should
          include `interval` _(The amount of interval for synochronizing the local
          data with the cloud database of your choice)_ and 600000ms or 10min is
          the minimum interval, you can extend from there. > [!WARNING] > Setting
          the interval is important, as the higher the better, but also too much
          high like 5hrs or more than that is too much! You can it keep moderate
          like 2-3hrs for production use and around 10-20min for testing and
          development purposes. ##### rage.config.json
